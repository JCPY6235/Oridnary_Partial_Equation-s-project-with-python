# Oridnary_Partial_Equation-s-project-with-python

# Implement the explicit Euler method, the implicit Euler method, the methodsymplectic Euler method and the Runge-Kutta method of four order

# Plot the approximate solutions in the plane (u; v) for each method used above 
## then compare with the solution given by odeint obtained in question 5) of pdf file.
## Check again the periodic character of the solution.
# Draw the field ofphase velocities, use matplotlib.quiver function
